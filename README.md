### What I learned

This is a very intering project, I learned a lot when doing this practice

First of all, I learned HTML tag to change to image with different device's width

```html
<picture>
      <source srcset="images/illustration-woman-online-mobile.svg" media="(max-width: 1023px)">
      <source srcset="images/illustration-box-desktop.svg" media="(min-width: 1023px)">
      <img src="images/illustration-woman-online-mobile.svg" alt="Illustration">
</picture>
```

Secondly, I also learned that there are two ways to do the FAQ, using `<dl>` tag or `<details>` tag
